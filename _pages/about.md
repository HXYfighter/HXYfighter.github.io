I am a **3rd-year Ph.D. candidate** in the Department of Electronic Engineering **at Tsinghua University, Beijing**, advised by Prof. Hao Zhang. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree also from Dept. EE, THU in 2022.

\* During January to July 2025, I am visiting at University of Cambridge, UK.

My research is mainly focused on **machine learning for drug discovery**, with the aim of making a greater contribution to humans' health and scientific discoveries through AI. I am also interested in cutting-edge AI topics including AI for medicine and healthcare, large language models, computer vision, and neuroscience. 

I have published papers at top-tier machine learning conferences including **NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR**, and served as a reviewer at these conferences.

Now, I am open to job and internship opportunities and look forward to academic exchange and collaboration.
