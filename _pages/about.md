I am a **4th-year Ph.D. candidate** in the Department of Electronic Engineering **at Tsinghua University, Beijing**, advised by Prof. Hao Zhang. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree also from Dept. EE, THU in 2022. During my Ph.D. study, I had the privilege of working as an intern at **Microsoft Research** and **AstraZeneca**, and visiting **University of Cambridge** and **MBZUAI**.

My research is mainly focused on **machine learning and AI for science (particularly drug discovery)**. I am also interested in cutting-edge AI topics including AI for medicine and healthcare, large language models, computer vision, neuroscience, and AI for social science. 

I have published papers at top-tier machine learning conferences including **NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI**, and served as a reviewer at these conferences.

I expect to **graduate in 2027**, and now I am actively seeking postdoc and industrial research opportunities around the world.
