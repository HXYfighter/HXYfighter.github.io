I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University, China, advised by Prof. Hao Zhang. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree also from Dept. EE, THU in 2022.

My research is mainly focused on **machine learning for drug discovery**, with the aim of making a greater contribution to humans' health and scientific discoveries through AI. I am also interested in cutting-edge AI topics such as large language models, computer vision, and neuroscience.

I am open to academic exchange and collaboration.
