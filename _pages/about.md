I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University, under the advisory of Prof. Hao Zhang. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's' degree also from Dept. EE, Tsinghua University.

**AI for Science** is the research field that I am passionate about. Currently, my research is focused on the application of **machine learning in drug discovery**. I use techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs) to design algorithms, with the aim of making a greater contribution to humans' health through AI. In addition, I am also interested in cutting-edge areas such as neuroscience and computer vision.
