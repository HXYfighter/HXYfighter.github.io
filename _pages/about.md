I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University, China, under the advisory of Prof. Hao Zhang. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree also from Dept. EE, Tsinghua University in 2022.

Currently, my research is focused on the application of **machine learning in drug discovery**, with the aim of making a greater contribution to humans' health and scientific discoveries through AI. In addition, I am also interested in cutting-edge AI topics such as large language models, neuroscience and computer vision.

I am open to academic exchanges and cooperation.
